Original Lead Migration Utility

This tool is not supported by IDX Broker. Do not contact them for help with this utility.

This utility will translate a lead export from an IDX Broker Original Account so that it can be imported on
an IDX Broker Platinum Account. It will not be able to translate the leads saved search information an make
this work on Platinum and these leads will need to have their saved searches set up manually within the
IDX Broker Platinum account.
